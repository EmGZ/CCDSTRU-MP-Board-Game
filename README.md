# CCDSTRU-MP-Board-Game
A custom board game that you can play in the CMD with 5 pieces for each player. Pieces could move like a pawn in chess but can capture pieces vertically and horizontally.
To win the game, the player must eat all the pieces or position their pieces where the opponent's pieces are in the beginning of the game.
